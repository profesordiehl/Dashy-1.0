## What is Student Retention?
> Student retention can be anything from counselors reaching out to students who are performing poorly, to schools using data to proactively identify students who are at-risk of dropping out of school.

> As our system of schools have grown, student retention has become a very important means of improving graduation rates, increasing alumni, and decreasing the loss of tuition dollars. While there are lots of different student retention strategies, itâ€™s easy to misuse resources without the data to show which students need the most help.

> By using Dashy as student retention software, our school administration and staff can better identify where at-risk students are and which retention strategies to implement.
